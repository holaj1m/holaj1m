# About
Hi! I'm Jim Tortella, a physics researcher interested in statistical mechanics, computational physics, and high performance programming. I'm currently working on active Brownian particles with Kuramoto-like interactions and the Q2R cellular automaton. I also have a project on data acquisition systems for two-dimensional materials.
